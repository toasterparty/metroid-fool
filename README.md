# April Fools 2024

> *Dedicated to everyone who has ever taken this game a little too seriously*

Experience Metroid Prime like never before. The planet of Tallon IV has been pumped full of propostorous puzzles, jovial japes and even a few sacrilegious stinkers. Do you have what it takes to endure them all?

## Features

This hack is the first fanhack to explore the new script-editing tools created for the patcher. As such, edits to rooms may produce more *"dynamic"* interractions with the player. It also makes use of all the usual patcher features such as a custom item/elevator/door layout, quality of life improvements, etc. All you need to know is I spent a lot of time trying to make this one impressive. I guarantee you have never seen anything like this.

## Difficulty

This hack is intended for players who have spent a non-trivial amount of time learning the likes of the speedrun, the randomizer, sequence breaking, etc. If you do not feel like you have a grasp on the fundamental techniques used by those kinds of runs, this hack may not be for you.

Example: 5-bomb jumps (e.g. UBJ) and wallcrawling are not required, but NSJ frigate crash site climb is.

## Before you play

Please do not unnesecarily spoil the contents of this hack when discussing in chat rooms or voice channels. If you are on the fence between playing this or watching someone else play, I would highly reccomend you play it first as this hack includes some surprises which can only be experienced once.

Please note that some unique lore is provided in and around Artifact Temple. No lore text outside of this area has been modified. I'm telling you this so you don't scan everything in fear of missing out.

## [‚ùî Hints](./hints.md)

Check here first if you're stuck in a specific room.

## [üôà Spoiler](./spoiler.md)
