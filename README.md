# Metroid Fool

> *Dedicated to each and every person who has ever taken this game a bit too seriously*

Experience Metroid Prime like never before by subjecting yourself to my creation centered around one brutally honest pillar - ***Subverted Expectations***. Re-discover Tallon IV as it has been stuffed with perplexing puzzles, jovial japes and even a few sacrilegious stinkers. Do you have what it takes to endure them all?

## Changelog

## Features

This hack is the first to explore the new script-editing tools created for the randomprime patcher. As a result, edits to rooms provide much more *"dynamic" üòè* interactions with the player than in any previously released mod. It also makes use of all the usual patcher features (e.g. shuffled items/elevators/doors, quality of life improvements etc...) seen previously.

This description of features is intentionally vague; All you need to know is I spent a *lot* of time trying to make this one interesting and memorable. While this project started as a glorified shitpost, I ended up getting extremely invested and it very well be my magnum opus. I promise you have never seen anything like this.

## Difficulty

This hack is intended for players who have spent a non-trivial amount of time learning the likes of the speedrun, the randomizer and other sequence-breaking runs. If you do not feel like you have a grasp on the fundamental techniques used by those kinds of runs, this hack may not be for you.

**Example**: 5-bomb jumps (e.g. UBJ) and wallcrawling are not required, but NSJ Frigate Crash Site climb is

## Before you play

Please do not unnecessarily spoil the contents of this hack when discussing in chat rooms or voice channels. If you are on the fence between playing this or watching someone else play, I would highly recommend you play it first as this hack includes some surprises which can only be experienced once.

Also, please note that some unique lore is provided in and around Artifact Temple. No lore text outside of this area has been modified. I'm telling you this so you don't scan everything in fear of missing out.

Check here first if you're stuck in a specific room.
