- Triclops Pit "windy grapple" climb
- **Triclops Pit - Nature**
- Monitor Station windy climb

### Early Phen

- Monitor Station -> Phendrana Shorelines
- Elevator Save Station
    - Early phen is all fucked up and confusing full of PoNR and room rando connections. Might even mix some far phen in there if I feel like it
    - Water level in shorelines is raised to prevent access to any door except for save station
    - Middle Shorelines Door Lock doesn't release on scan, instead it hints that the scan is found elsewhere
    - Boost is required to proceed past ruined courtyard (the water levels are reversed, it starts up and goes down when the puzzle is activated)

```
Elevator -> Shorelines Entrance -> Shorelines (Entrance)
Shorelines (Lower) -> Quarantine Access -> IRW (North)
IRW (West) -> Plaza Walkway -> IRE (Lower) -> Ice Ruins Access -> Hunter Cave (Lower)
Hunter Cave (Lower) -> Upper Edge Tunnel -> Gravity Chamber (Upper) -> Canyon Entryway -> Phendrana's Edge (Tunnel)
Phendrana's Edge (Bottom) -> Frost Cave Access -> Phendrana Canyon
```

**Phendrana Canyon - Charge Beam**

```
Phendrana's Edge (Middle) -> Lake Tunnel -> Hunter Cave (Upper)
Hunter Cave (Upper) -> Temple Entryway -> Frost Cave (Lower)
Frost Cave (Save) -> Lower Edge Tunnel -> Chozo Ice Temple (East)
```

**Chozo Ice Temple - Bomb Slot Activated**

```

```
Frost Cave (Upper) -> Hunter Cave Access -> Shorelines (Upper)
Shorelines (Upper) -> Save Station C

```

**Security Cave - Shoreline Door Unlocked**

```
Shorelines (Locked) -> Chamber Access -> North Quarantine Tunnel -> Chapel of the Elders
```

### Sheegoth Fight 
    - Force morphed for the whole fight
    - Sheegoths spawn on pyramid-shaped turrets and you have to climb them to bomb them to death without unmorphing
- **Chapel of the Elders - Boost Ball**

### Labs False Start

```
Phendrana's Edge (Hidden Door) -> Courtyard Entryway -> Ruined Courtyard (Lower)
```

Ruined Courtyard puzzle but the water levels are inverted and the labs door is unpowered instead of Quarantine Access
**Ruined Courtyard - E-Tank**

```
Ruined Courtyard (Quarantine Door) -> Save Station B
Ruined Courtyard (Labs) -> Specimen Storage
```

*Need Supers and Wave to proceed into labs*

### Backtrack

- Unlock Geothermal Core ceiling with the help of Grapple. Wave Beam extends out with the piston.
    - TODO: Grapple Beam R-Tech skill check is needed before this point, otherwise it's too punishing
- **Geothermal Core - Wave Beam**
- Reverse Piston Tunnel/Training Chamber
- **Training Chamber Access - Super Missiles**

### Labs

- Research Entrance through Research Core has the following:
    - Vanilla room connections
    - Low gravity
    - Increased combat levels
- Low gravity vertical puzzle in control tower. Must be possible NSJ/low-grav AND SJ/normal-grav
- **Control Tower - Elder**
- *Pike Access requires normal gravity to proceed*
- **Research Core - Restore Gravity**

### Labs -> Thardus

- Frozen Pike (Hunter) -> Storage Cave
- **Storage Cave - Spirit**
- Frozen Pike (Frost) -> Security Cave
- Quarantine Cave Elevator - Save Station
- *Elevator platform goes up instead of down and requires Spider Ball to reach*

### Thardus

- *Fight activates after grabbing spider instead of before*
- **Quarantine Cave - Spider**
- Thardus fight:
    - Still brainstorming. I'd like to try putting him in jail and then blocking his weak points with blocks. You'd have to do spider track horse shit to unlock them all. Could even split up the fight into two phases - one with normal tracks and then one with low-grav tracks.

### Late Magmoor

- *Early-Magmoor access is blocked*
- *Pass through one-way ice door when entering Geothermal Core*
- *Plasma Processing door is Power Bomb locked*

- **Plasma Processing - Plasma Beam**
    - Grabbing Plasma changes the Geothermal Core layer and reloads the room
- Reggie's Geothermal Core morph ball track from hell
    - Falling back down the room is blocked by a shallow pool of magma. If the player does this, they can hop their way back to the start of the morph track.
    - Completing the track and collecting a nothing item removes the floor and allows the player to leave
- **Gully - Gravity Suit**
- **Chozo Ice Temple - Sun**

### Late Mines

- *Everything from QAA to EQA has had all of the enemies removed. Instead of combat, these rooms focus on challenging NSJ platforming sections. The ambient light level has be raised too. Phazon isn't an issue.*

    - Try goomba stacking again idk?
