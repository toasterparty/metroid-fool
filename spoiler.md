### Artifact Return Policy

- **Artifact Temple - Phazon Suit**
- The long-con farce is finally revealed. The player must return any and all artifacts which they have collected to enter the crater, and the ghosts are angry about it. The player must deal with some or all of the following depending on which artifacts they "stole":
    - **Chozo**: Life Grove ghost fight
    - **Lifegiver**: Ruined Shrine ghost fight
    - **World**: HoTE ghost fight
    - **Wild**: Sunchamber ghost fight
    - **Nature**: Invincible flying pirates in Triclops Pit puzzle
    - **Strength**: Warrior Shrine but it's up high
    - **Elder**: Control Tower but they don't get to enjoy low gravity
    - **Sun**: The sheegoth and bombus are crowded in the artifact cubby
    - **Spirit**: It's an annoying room to reach
    - **Warrior**: Phazon Elite active
    - **Newborn**: Blocks require power bombs
- I like to give players a lollipop after punching them in the face so you can have your Ship back and I upgraded it so it can fly to/from any elevator in any region

## Missile Expansions

- No one will actually finish with this missile count because of Root Cave
