## Route

In general, the harder it is to reach a missile, the more rewarding it is.
Beetles are never encountered *after* the Ruined Shrine fight.
Ghosts are never encoutnered *before* the Artifact farce is revealed.
Every time an artifact is stolen, something weird happens.

### Early Phen

- Monitor Station -> Phendrana Shorelines
- Elevator Save Station
    - Early phen is all fucked up and confusing full of PoNR and room rando connections. Might even mix some far phen in there if I feel like it
    - Water level in shorelines is raised to prevent access to any door except for save station
    - Middle Shorelines Door Lock doesn't release on scan, instead it hints that the scan is found elsewhere
    - Boost is required to proceed past ruined courtyard (the water levels are reversed, it starts up and goes down when the puzzle is activated)

```
Ruined Courtyard (Quarantine Door) -> Save Station B
Ruined Courtyard (Labs) -> Specimen Storage
```

*Need Supers and Wave to proceed into labs*

### Backtrack

- Unlock Geothermal Core ceiling with the help of Grapple. Wave Beam extends out with the piston.
- **Geothermal Core - Wave Beam**
- Reverse Piston Tunnel/Training Chamber
- **Training Chamber Access - Super Missiles**

### Labs

- Research Entrance through Research Core has the following:
    - Vanilla room connections
    - Low gravity
    - Increased combat levels
- Low gravity vertical puzzle in control tower. Must be possible NSJ/low-grav AND SJ/normal-grav
- **Control Tower - Elder**

- **Research Core - Restore Gravity**

### Labs -> Thardus

- Frozen Pike (Hunter) -> Storage Cave
- **Storage Cave - Spirit**
- Frozen Pike (Frost) -> Security Cave

- *Elevator platform goes up instead of down and requires Spider Ball to reach*

### Thardus

- *Fight activates after grabbing spider instead of before*
- **Quarantine Cave - Spider**
- Thardus fight:
    - Still brainstorming. I'd like to try putting him in jail and then blocking his weak points with blocks. You'd have to do spider track horse shit to unlock them all. Could even split up the fight into two phases - one with normal tracks and then one with low-grav tracks.

### Late Magmoor

- *Early-Magmoor access is blocked*
- *Pass through one-way ice door when entering Geothermal Core*
- *Plasma Processing door is Power Bomb locked*

- **Plasma Processing - Plasma Beam**

    - Completing the track and collecting a nothing item removes the floor and allows the player to leave

### Late Mines

- *If the player wants to fuck off all the way back to Landing Site, they can open a plasma door and get Gravity Suit in Gully which does fuck all. Do you want a cookie too?*
- *Everything from QAA to EQA has had all of the enemies removed. Instead of combat, these rooms focus on challenging NSJ platforming sections. The ambient light level has be raised too. Phazon isn't an issue.*

## Lore

### Temple Security Station

> Log Entry 3024-04-01
> Dear diary,
> Today the commander ordered me to hike all the way out to the middle of f'ing nowhere to secure an objective. It was a pain in the ass to carry all my equipment underneath that gap in the rock just ahead. I completed the task by installing a FD39 MKII Laser Defense Barrier and calling it a day. It's very peaceful out here compared to the mines. I think I'll camp out here tonight and leave in the morning. Hopefully a Zebian-class research facility doesn't crash on my head on the journey back.
> Love,
> Space Private Glorgsmire Gumpybottom First Class

### Artifact Temple

*TBD - Something that foreshadows that the ghosts are happy with where the artifacts are located and they don't need collecting.*
