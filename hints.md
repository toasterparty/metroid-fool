  <summary>I'm having trouble in Hunter Cave</summary>

```
Dash off the lower grapple point towards the higher one using the "starting to grapple" animation instead of scan dashing. Once in the air, look up as quickly as possible to grab onto the 2nd grapple point. This is called "Grapple Dashing"
