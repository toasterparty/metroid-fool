It was a pain in the ass to carry all my equipment underneath that gap in the rock just ahead. I completed the task by installing a FD39 MKII Laser Defense Matrix and calling it a day.\n\nIt's very peaceful out here compared to the mines. I think I'll camp out here tonight and leave in the morning. Hopefully a Zebian-class research facility doesn't crash on my head on the journey back.\n\nLove,\n\nSpace Private Glorgsmire Gumpybottom First Class"
